## Introduction

This repo and its Wiki contain in- and out-of-realm information for the Megachannel Modded Minecraft Realm (Megamod).  This realm is whitelist-enforced, meaning no player may join without being added to the whitelist.  If you are unable to connect, please contact Jeff.

## Prerequisites:

- If you haven't already, download the 12.2 vanilla launcher by going into your Minecraft launcher, then "Installations" at the top, and "(+) New"

- Under "Version", hit the dropdown and select "Release 1.12.2"

- Hit "Play" on the 1.12.2 release you just installed - it must be run at least once in order to install things properly later on


## Instructions:

- Go to http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html and download the `Installer` file under `Download Recommended`.

- Run the downloaded `forge-<version>-installer.jar`, which will pop up an install dialog

- Save the directory shown in the pop-up, as this is where you will need to install the mods
  
  - On Mac, it is: `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/minecraft`

- Select "Install client" and click "OK"

- Download the mods for the server (list at the end of this guide) and place the `.jar` files in the `mods` directory

- In the Minecraft launcher, go to "Installations" and look for your forge launcher

  - If it is the wrong version (e.g. 1.10.12-forge), hover over the forge launcher, click the "..." at the right, and click "Edit".  Under "Version", hit the dropdown and select the option that begins with "release 10.12.2", and hit "Save".
  
- Hit "Play" on the forge launcher
